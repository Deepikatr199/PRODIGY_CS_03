Password Complexity Checker
Developed a robust tool in Python to assess password strength, enhancing my expertise in cybersecurity. Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of password security best practices and the importance of robust authentication mechanisms.
It considers the length of the password, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The assessment is categorized into "Weak", "Moderate", "Strong", and "Very Strong" based on the score calculated from the criteria.
